config/
	reports.php

	// a list of report 'types'
		each report type has a class file elsewhere

		for each report that we want to run, we get the file
			feed that file



			each class
				get attributes


				make a list of things that can go on x axis
				make a list of things that can go on the Y axis

				

I also need a way to get distinct atributes per column

	so i can get a list of all the device types
	count by device type



	TODO:

	figure out where the hell i need to stash CSVImporter
	hook up the IoC bindings
	update to work with dataController
